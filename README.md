tired of the squiggly red lines from typing "console.log" because you were just working on a javascript front end five minutes ago? just want to print one goddamn line to the console but can't remember what to type because there's too many fucking print statements? well do i have news for you. ***HI BILLY MAYS HERE*** for ALLPRINT. a pypi package that lets you use all print statements from any coding language**. simply type `from allPrint import *` at the top of any python file. it just works.
